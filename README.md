## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue in this repository. The issue description contains details on the prospective feature. 

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every item is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.  You'll also find a **Future** column for when no timeframe is yet available.
